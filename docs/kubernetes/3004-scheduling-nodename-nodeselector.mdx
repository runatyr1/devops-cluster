# ‚è∞ Scheduling - Pods with nodeName and nodeSelector

When deploying pods in Kubernetes, you can control which nodes they are scheduled on using the `nodeName` or `nodeSelector` fields in the pod spec. Let's explore these two methods and compare their differences.

## Practice

### Step 1: Scheduling with nodeName

<details>
<summary>Toggle to view the YAML config</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-nodename
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: web-server
  nodeName: node1
```

</details>

To schedule a pod on a specific node using `nodeName`:

1. Set the `nodeName` field in the pod spec to the name of the desired node.
2. Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-with-nodename.yaml
```

3. Verify the pod is scheduled on the specified node:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

### Step 2: Scheduling with nodeSelector

<details>
<summary>Toggle to view the YAML config</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-nodeselector
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: web-server
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
```

</details>

To schedule a pod using `nodeSelector`:

1. Add labels to the nodes you want to select:

```bash
kubectl label nodes node2 disktype=ssd
```

2. Set the `nodeSelector` field in the pod spec with the desired label key-value pair.
3. Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-with-nodeselector.yaml
```

4. Verify the pod is scheduled on a node with the matching label:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

## Comparison

Let's compare `nodeName` and `nodeSelector` using a sample scenario:

- You have a 3-node cluster with nodes named `node1`, `node2`, and `node3`.
- `node1` and `node2` have SSDs attached and are labeled with `disktype=ssd`.
- You want to deploy a pod that requires high disk I/O performance.

| Aspect | nodeName | nodeSelector |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Specificity | Schedules the pod on a specific node by name | Schedules the pod on any node matching the label selector |
| Flexibility | Inflexible, tied to a single node | Flexible, can schedule on multiple nodes with matching labels |
| Maintenance | Requires updating the pod spec when the node changes | Allows updating node labels without modifying the pod spec |
| Load Balancing | Manual load balancing by specifying nodes | Automatic load balancing across nodes with matching labels |

In this scenario, using `nodeSelector` with `disktype=ssd` would be more flexible and maintainable, as the pod can be scheduled on either `node1` or `node2` without modifying the pod spec. This allows for better load balancing and easier updates to the cluster configuration.

## Conclusion

Both `nodeName` and `nodeSelector` provide ways to control pod scheduling in Kubernetes. While `nodeName` is more specific, `nodeSelector` offers greater flexibility and maintainability. Choose the method that best fits your application requirements and cluster management strategy.
