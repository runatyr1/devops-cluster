# ðŸ’¾ Storage - Tricky Pod Using PV, PVC and SC

In this exercise, we'll walk through the process of setting up storage components in a Kubernetes cluster. This includes creating a Storage Class, Persistent Volume (PV), Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), and a Pod that uses the storage.

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Create a Storage Class

Create a Storage Class named `blue-stc-cka` with the following properties:

- Provisioner: `kubernetes.io/no-provisioner`
- Volume binding mode: `WaitForFirstConsumer`

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: blue-stc-cka
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

Apply this configuration using `kubectl apply -f storageclass.yaml`.
</details>

```bash
kubectl get sc blue-stc-cka
```

### Step 2: Create a Persistent Volume (PV)

Create a PV named `blue-pv-cka` with the following properties:

- Capacity: 100Mi
- Access mode: ReadWriteOnce
- Reclaim policy: Retain
- Storage class: `blue-stc-cka`
- Local path: `/opt/blue-data-cka`
- Node affinity: Set node affinity to create this PV on controlplane

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: blue-pv-cka
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 100Mi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: blue-stc-cka
  local:
    path: /opt/blue-data-cka
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
          operator: Exists
```

Apply this configuration using `kubectl apply -f pv.yaml`.
</details>

```bash
kubectl get pv blue-pv-cka
```

### Step 3: Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

Create a PVC named `blue-pvc-cka` with the following properties:

- Access mode: ReadWriteOnce
- Storage class: `blue-stc-cka`
- Storage request: 50Mi
- The volume should be bound to `blue-pv-cka`

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: blue-pvc-cka
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Mi
  storageClassName: blue-stc-cka
  volumeName: blue-pv-cka
```

Apply this configuration using `kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml`.
</details>

```bash
kubectl get pvc blue-pvc-cka
```

### Step 4: Create a Pod Using the PVC

Create a Pod that uses the PVC we just created.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: blue-pvc-cka
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
          name: mypd
  nodeName: controlplane
```

Apply this configuration using `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`.
</details>

```bash
kubectl get pod mypod
```

## Troubleshooting and Tips

Throughout this exercise, several challenges were encountered. Here are some troubleshooting tips:

- **PVC Binding Issues**: If the PVC is not binding to the PV, check the following:
  - Ensure the StorageClass, PV, and PVC configurations match, especially the `storageClassName`.
  - For StorageClasses with `WaitForFirstConsumer` binding mode, the PVC won't bind until a Pod tries to use it.
  - Consider specifying the `volumeName` in the PVC to force binding to a specific PV.

- **Pod Scheduling**: If the Pod is not being scheduled:
  - Check the node selector or `nodeName` in the Pod specification.
  - Ensure the specified node exists and is ready.
  - If using control plane nodes, be aware of taints that might prevent scheduling.

- **Volume Mounting Issues**: If the Pod is stuck in `ContainerCreating` state:
  - Verify that the local path specified in the PV exists on the node.
  - Check node labels if using node affinity in the PV.
  - Look for `FailedMount` events in the Pod description.

- **Local Path Preparation**: Remember to create the directory specified in the PV's local path on the correct node:

  ```bash
  mkdir /opt/blue-data-cka
  ```

- **Verifying Configuration**: Use these commands to verify your setup:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pv,pvc,pod
  kubectl describe pv blue-pv-cka
  kubectl describe pvc blue-pvc-cka
  kubectl describe pod mypod
  ```

- **Testing Volume Mounting**: Once the Pod is running, you can test if the volume is correctly mounted:

  ```bash
  kubectl exec mypod -- ls /var/www/html
  ```

Remember, Kubernetes storage configuration can be complex. Always double-check your YAML indentation, and don't hesitate to use `kubectl explain` for help with API object fields.

Also, when looking for information about node labels like node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane, you can find it in the "Well-Known Labels, Annotations and Taints" page:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/

## Conclusion

This exercise demonstrates the intricacies of setting up storage in Kubernetes. By working through these steps and troubleshooting issues, you've gained practical experience with Storage Classes, Persistent Volumes, Persistent Volume Claims, and Pod storage configuration. These skills are crucial for managing stateful applications in Kubernetes environments.
