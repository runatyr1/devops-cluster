# üè¢ Cluster  - Etcd Backup and Restore

In this article, we will go through the process of backing up and restoring the etcd configuration in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Check the Current Configuration

First, let's check if the configuration exists:

```bash
k get ds -A
```

## Backup the Configuration

To backup the etcd configuration, use the following command:

```bash
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  snapshot save snapshot.db
```

This command creates a snapshot of the etcd configuration and saves it to a file named `snapshot.db`.

## Delete the Configuration

To simulate a configuration loss, let's delete the `kube-proxy` DaemonSet:

```bash
k delete ds kube-proxy -n kube-system
```

Now, when you check the configuration again using `k get ds -A`, you will notice that the `kube-proxy` DaemonSet is gone.

## Restore the Configuration

To restore the etcd configuration from the snapshot, follow these steps:

1. Set the `ETCDCTL_API` environment variable:

```bash
export ETCDCTL_API=3
```

2. Restore the snapshot:

```bash
etcdctl --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-restore snapshot restore snapshot.db
```

3. Edit the etcd manifest file:

```bash
nano /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
```

4. Change the `data-dir` value to `/var/lib/etcd-restore`.

## Verify the Restoration

Finally, check the configuration again using `k get ds -A`. You should see that the `kube-proxy` DaemonSet is back, indicating a successful restoration of the etcd configuration.

By following these steps, you can easily backup and restore the etcd configuration in your Kubernetes cluster, ensuring data integrity and minimizing downtime in case of configuration loss.
