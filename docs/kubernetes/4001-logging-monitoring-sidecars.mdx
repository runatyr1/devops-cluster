# ðŸ“Š Logging & Monitoring - Sidecar Containers

In Kubernetes, you can use sidecar containers to collect logs from the main container in a pod. Here's an example of how to set this up:

<details>
<summary>pod-logging-sidecar.yaml</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-logging-sidecar
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    name: main
    args: [ 'sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo "$(date)\n" >> /var/log/main-container.log; sleep 5; done' ]
    volumeMounts:
      - name: varlog
        mountPath: /var/log
  - name: sidecar
    image: busybox
    args: [ /bin/sh, -c, 'tail -f /var/log/main-container.log' ]
    volumeMounts:
      - name: varlog
        mountPath: /var/log
  volumes:
    - name: varlog
      emptyDir: {}
```

</details>

This pod definition has two containers:
1. The `main` container writes logs to `/var/log/main-container.log` every 5 seconds
2. The `sidecar` container tails the log file from the main container

Both containers mount a shared `emptyDir` volume at `/var/log` to access the log file.

To view the logs from the sidecar container, use:

```bash
kubectl logs pod-logging-sidecar -c sidecar
```

To view logs from all containers in the pod:

```bash
kubectl logs pod-logging-sidecar --all-containers
```

And to follow the logs:

```bash
kubectl logs pod-logging-sidecar --all-containers -f
```

## Why use a sidecar container for logging?

Sidecar containers are useful for logging because:
- They allow separating logging concerns from the main application 
- The main container doesn't need to be modified to send logs externally
- Logs can be collected, processed, and shipped by the sidecar without impacting the main workload
- Different sidecar logging implementations can be used with the same main container
