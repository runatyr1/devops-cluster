# ‚è∞ Scheduling - Node Affinity

Node affinity is a way to control which nodes a pod can be scheduled on based on labels on the nodes. It provides a more expressive syntax than `nodeSelector` for controlling where pods are scheduled.

## Example: Prefer Scheduling on Specific Nodes

Let's look at an example of using node affinity to prefer scheduling a pod on nodes with specific labels.

<details>
<summary>Pod Config</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: az1-pod
  name: az1-pod
  namespace: 012963bd
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 80
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: availability-zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - zone1
      - weight: 20
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: availability-zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - zone2
  containers:
  - image: nginx:1.24.0
    name: az1-pod
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

</details>

This pod config uses `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` to specify that the pod should prefer to be scheduled on a node with the label `availability-zone=zone1` with a weight of 80, and `availability-zone=zone2` with a weight of 20.

To verify that the affinity is in the running config, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe pod az1-pod -n 012963bd
```

Look for the `Node-Affinity` field in the output to see the affinity rules.

## Anti-Affinity

Anti-affinity is the opposite of affinity - it allows you to specify that a pod should not be scheduled on a node with certain labels. 

For example, you could use anti-affinity to ensure that pods from the same application are not scheduled on the same node, for high availability:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-server
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: app
            operator: In
            values:
            - web-store
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```

This would prevent multiple pods with the label `app=web-store` from being scheduled on the same node.

For more details, see the [Kubernetes docs on affinity and anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).
