# üè¢ Cluster - Upgrading with kubeadm

Practice how to add the kubernetes repo in debian based linux, and install or upgrade different components. <br/>
You can find the installation instructions for kubeadm in the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#installing-kubeadm-kubelet-and-kubectl).


## Upgrading kubeadm


To add the Kubernetes apt repository and install kubeadm, follow these steps:

1. Update your package list and install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg
   ```

2. Download the public signing key for the Kubernetes package repositories:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
   ```

3. Add the appropriate Kubernetes apt repository:
   ```bash
   echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
   ```

4. Update the package list and check available versions of kubeadm:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   apt-cache policy kubeadm
   ```

   This command will show you the installed version and the versions available for installation. For example:

   ```
   kubeadm:
     Installed: 1.30.0-1.1
     Candidate: 1.31.1-1.1
     Version table:
        1.31.1-1.1 500
           500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb  Packages
        1.31.0-1.1 500
           500 https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb  Packages
    *** 1.30.0-1.1 100
           100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
   ```

5. Install the desired version of kubeadm:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.31.1-1.1 kubeadm=1.31.1-1.1 kubectl=1.31.1-1.1
   sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   ```

   Replace `1.31.1-1.1` with the version you want to install.

6. Verify the upgrade:
   ```bash
   kubeadm version
   ```

## Upgrading Your Cluster

Once kubeadm is upgraded, you can use it to upgrade your cluster:

1. Plan the upgrade:
   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
   ```
   This will show you the components that will be upgraded.

2. Apply the upgrade:
   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm upgrade apply <version>
   ```
   Replace `<version>` with the version you're upgrading to.

3. Upgrade kubelet and kubectl on all nodes:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install kubelet=<version> kubectl=<version>
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart kubelet
   ```

Remember to drain nodes before upgrading and uncordon them after the upgrade is complete.
