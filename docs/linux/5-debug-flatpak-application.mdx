# Debugging a Crashing Flatpak Application

To debug a crashing Flatpak application, follow these steps:

1. Install the Flatpak SDK for your desktop environment. For KDE, use:
   ```bash
   flatpak install flathub org.kde.Sdk//5.15-21.08
   ```

2. Install GDB (GNU Debugger) using your package manager. For dnf:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install gdb
   ```

3. List the Flatpak applications to find the application ID. For example, to find the "megasync" app:
   ```bash
   flatpak list | { head -n 1; grep -i megasync; }
   ```

4. Find the location of the binary in the Flatpak sandbox. Replace `nz.mega.MEGAsync` with your app ID:
   ```bash
   flatpak run --devel --command=sh nz.mega.MEGAsync
   find /app -iname 'megasync'
   ```

5. Run the Flatpak application in development mode using GDB. Replace `nz.mega.MEGAsync` and `/app/bin/megasync` with your app ID and binary path:
   ```bash
   flatpak run --devel --command=gdb nz.mega.MEGAsync /app/bin/megasync
   ```

6. Type `run` at the (gdb) prompt and wait for the application to start.

7. When the app crashes, copy the output around the error. For example:
   ```
   [Thread 0x7fffa37fe640 (LWP 1451) exited]
   [New Thread 0x7fffa37fe640 (LWP 1453)]
   [Thread 0x7fffa37fe640 (LWP 1453) exited]
   Thread 1 "megasync" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
   0x00007ffff455321c in __longjmp () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
   [1]+  Stopped                 flatpak run --devel --command=gdb nz.mega.MEGAsync /app/bin/megasync
   ```

8. If the GDB prompt is still running, type `backtrace` and copy the information.

9. Investigate the error and report it in the corresponding Flathub repository, such as https://github.com/flathub/nz.mega.MEGAsync/issues for the "megasync" app.

By following these steps, you can effectively debug a crashing Flatpak application and gather the necessary information to report the issue.
