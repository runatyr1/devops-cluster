# Resizing zRAM Swap in Linux

To resize the zRAM swap in Linux, follow these steps:

1. Verify that you are using zRAM:

```bash
swapon --show
```

The output should show a zram file like this:

```
NAME       TYPE       SIZE USED PRIO
/dev/zram0 partition 31.2G 9.7G  100
```

2. Deactivate the current zRAM swap device:

```bash
sudo swapoff /dev/zram0
```

:::caution
Deactivating the zRAM swap device might temporarily slow down your system as the contents of the swap will be transferred back to the RAM.
:::

3. Create a new swap file with the desired size (64GB):

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 64G /swapfile
```

4. Set the correct permissions for the swap file:

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```

5. Format the swap file as swap:

```bash
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```

6. Enable the new swap file:

```bash
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

7. Make the swap file persistent across reboots by adding an entry in `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

8. Reboot your system to ensure the new swap file is functioning correctly:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After completing these steps, you should have a 64GB swap file enabled on your system. You can verify this by running `swapon --show` or `free -h`.
