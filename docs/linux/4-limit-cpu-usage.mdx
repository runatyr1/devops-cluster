# Limiting CPU Usage of a Process

Is there a process that tends to use a lot of CPU but is not that important? You can use **`cpulimit`** to limit a process's CPU usage by its name. Here's how to install and use **`cpulimit`**:

1. Install **`cpulimit`**:
   - On Debian-based systems like Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install cpulimit
     ```
   - On Fedora:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install cpulimit
     ```

2. Identify the process name you want to limit. For example, let's say the process name is **`your_process_name`**.

3. Limit the process's CPU usage to 50%:
   ```bash
   cpulimit -e your_process_name -l 50
   ```
   The **`-e`** flag specifies the process name, and the **`-l`** flag sets the CPU usage percentage limit.

To make this change permanent and apply the limit automatically every time the system starts, you can create a systemd service:

1. Create a new systemd service file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cpulimit-your_process_name.service
   ```
   Replace **`your_process_name`** with the actual process name.

2. Add the following content to the file, replacing **`your_process_name`** with the actual process name:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=CPU limit for your_process_name
   After=network.target
   
   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/cpulimit -e your_process_name -l 50
   Restart=on-failure
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Enable and start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable cpulimit-your_process_name.service
   sudo systemctl start cpulimit-your_process_name.service
   ```
   Replace **`your_process_name`** with the actual process name.

Now, the CPU limit will be applied automatically every time your system starts.

:::note
**`cpulimit`** might not be the best solution for long-term CPU limiting, as it continuously polls the process and adjusts the CPU usage. For more sophisticated control, consider using Linux control groups (cgroups), which offer more fine-grained resource management for processes.
