# Automating a Linux non-interactive prompt

`expect` is a powerful tool for automating non-interactive shell prompts. Here's an example of using `expect` to automatically type an `scp` passphrase while sending a file to a remote server:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y expect; \
expect -c 'set timeout 10
set source "src/packages.tgz"
set destination "root@myserver:"
set key "src/mykey.key"
set passphrase "mypassphrase"
spawn scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i $key $source $destination;
expect "Enter passphrase for key.*"
send "$passphrase\r"
interact'
```

The dot star `.*` in the expect string `"Enter passphrase for key.*"` matches anything after that string, since this prompt has additional information.

:::warning

Note: Automating password-related tasks is not secure, but it can be useful for uninportant servers or learning purposes.

Alternatively, you can use `sshpass` to solve this use case:

```bash
sshpass -p "mypassphrase" scp -r user@example.com:/some/remote/path /some/local/path
```

However, if you need to automate entering information into a shell prompt for something other than an SSH password, `expect` is a valuable tool to have in your arsenal.
