# Extending `sudo dnf install` Functionality

To extend the functionality of `sudo dnf install` and run a custom script after package installation:

1. Add this function to your shell's configuration file (`.bashrc` for Bash, `.zshrc` for Zsh):

```bash
sudo() {
    if [ "$1" == "dnf" ] && [ "$2" == "install" ]; then
        command sudo "$@"
        /path/to/custom/script.sh
    else
        command sudo "$@"
    fi
}
```

2. Replace `/path/to/custom/script.sh` with the actual path to your script.

3. Apply the changes by restarting your shell or running:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # for Bash
# or
source ~/.zshrc   # for Zsh
```

Now, when you run `sudo dnf install package_name`, your custom script will execute after the package installation without affecting other `dnf` subcommands.

This modification allows you to `extend the functionality` of the `sudo dnf install` command by running a custom script after the package installation, providing flexibility to perform additional tasks seamlessly.
